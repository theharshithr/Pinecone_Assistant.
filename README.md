## 🚀 Getting Started  
Clone the repo and follow the installation steps to set up your own PDF assistant.  

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/theharshithr/Pinecone_Assistant.
cd Pinecone_Assistant.ipynb
pip install -r requirements.txt (In this case if you use ur libraries external use this method)
.env (add a line load dotenv() when u want to send API_KEYS from a different environment file and access it in coding env)
python app.py
```

**Pinecone** is a managed vector database optimized for high-dimensional data, enabling efficient similarity searches in AI applications. **Pinecone Assistant** extends this by adding retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities for document analysis and context-aware responses. Below is a concise guide to integrating these tools into your projects.

## **Integration Steps for Document Analysis**

### 1. **Set Up Pinecone Assistant**
```bash
npx create-pinecone-app@latest --template pinecone-assistant
```
- Install dependencies and configure `.env`:
  ```env
  PINECONE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
  PINECONE_ASSISTANT_NAME="your_assistant_name"
  ```

### 2. **Upload Documents**
```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
assistant = pc.assistants.create(name="doc-analyzer")

# Upload a PDF
assistant.upload(file_path="document.pdf", metadata={"category": "research"})
```

### 3. **Query Documents**
```python
response = assistant.chat(messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the key findings."}
])

# Stream responses
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
```

### 4. **Retrieve Context Snippets**
```python
context = assistant.retrieve_context(query="climate change impacts")
for snippet in context:
    print(f"Source: {snippet.metadata['source']}\nText: {snippet.text}")
```
